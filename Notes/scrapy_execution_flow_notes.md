### Execution Flow of a Scrapy Project

Scrapy follows a well-defined execution process when running a Scrapy spider. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how Scrapy works, where execution starts, and how different components interact.

---

## 1. Execution Begins: Running a Scrapy Command
Execution starts when the following command is run:
```bash
scrapy crawl quotes
```
- `scrapy` is the command-line tool.
- `crawl quotes` tells Scrapy to run the spider named **quotes**.
- Scrapy looks for the spider definition in the `spiders/` directory.

---

## 2. Scrapy Engine Starts
The Scrapy **Engine** is the core component that coordinates the crawling and scraping process.
1. It finds the spider named **quotes**.
2. Calls the `start_requests` method of the spider.
3. Sends the first request(s) to the **Scheduler**.

---

## 3. Scheduler Queues Requests
- The **Scheduler** organizes the requests and ensures they are executed efficiently.
- It stores them in an internal queue and sends them one by one to the **Downloader**.

---

## 4. Downloader Fetches the Webpage
- The **Downloader** takes requests from the Scheduler and makes HTTP requests to the target website.
- It downloads the webpage and passes the **response** to the Scrapy **Engine**.

---

## 5. Response Goes to Spider’s `parse` Method
Once the **Engine** receives the response, it calls the spider’s `parse` method.

Example `spiders/quotes.py`:
```python
import scrapy

class QuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "quotes"
    start_urls = ["https://quotes.toscrape.com"]

    def parse(self, response):
        for quote in response.css("div.quote"):
            yield {
                "text": quote.css("span.text::text").get(),
                "author": quote.css("small.author::text").get(),
                "tags": quote.css("div.tags a.tag::text").getall(),
            }
        next_page = response.css("li.next a::attr(href)").get()
        if next_page:
            yield response.follow(next_page, self.parse)
```

### Execution of `parse` method:
1. Extracts **quotes, authors, and tags** from the `response` object.
2. **Yields items**, which Scrapy sends to the **Item Pipeline**.
3. Finds the **next page URL** and follows it recursively.

---

## 6. Item Pipeline Processes the Data
Once the spider yields an item, Scrapy sends it to the **Item Pipeline** (`pipelines.py`).

Example `pipelines.py`:
```python
import sqlite3

class SQLitePipeline:
    def open_spider(self, spider):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect("quotes.db")
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        self.cursor.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quotes (
                text TEXT, author TEXT, tags TEXT
            )
        """)

    def process_item(self, item, spider):
        self.cursor.execute("INSERT INTO quotes VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                            (item["text"], item["author"], ", ".join(item["tags"])))
        self.conn.commit()
        return item

    def close_spider(self, spider):
        self.conn.close()
```

### How `pipelines.py` Handles Data:
1. `open_spider(self, spider)`: Runs when the spider starts.
2. `process_item(self, item, spider)`: Processes and stores each scraped item.
3. `close_spider(self, spider)`: Runs when the spider finishes.

---

## 7. Handling Pagination
If the spider finds a **next page link**, it:
1. **Creates a new request** (`response.follow(next_page, self.parse)`).
2. Sends the request **back to the Scheduler**.
3. The **Scheduler sends it to the Downloader**.
4. The **process repeats until no more pages exist**.

---

## 8. Spider Finishes and Closes
When there are no more requests:
1. The Scrapy **Engine stops** execution.
2. The **Pipeline’s `close_spider` method** is called.
3. The **Scrapy job completes**.

---

## Overall Execution Flow (Step-by-Step)
| Step | Component | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **1** | **User runs `scrapy crawl spider_name`** | Starts Scrapy execution |
| **2** | **Scrapy Engine** | Initializes Scrapy components |
| **3** | **Spider (`quotes.py`)** | `start_requests()` sends initial request(s) |
| **4** | **Scheduler** | Queues requests and sends them to the downloader |
| **5** | **Downloader** | Fetches web pages and returns responses |
| **6** | **Spider `parse` method** | Extracts data and follows pagination |
| **7** | **Item Pipeline (`pipelines.py`)** | Processes and stores scraped data |
| **8** | **Scheduler** | Handles additional requests (pagination) |
| **9** | **Scrapy Engine Stops** | When no more requests exist |

## Summary
1. Execution starts when `scrapy crawl spider_name` runs.
2. The Scrapy **Engine** calls the spider’s `start_requests()`.
3. The **Scheduler queues requests** and sends them to the **Downloader**.
4. The **Downloader fetches the webpage** and sends the response to the **Spider**.
5. The **Spider extracts data** in `parse()`, and:
   - **Yields items → Sent to the Pipeline**.
   - **Finds next page → Sends new request to Scheduler**.
6. **Item Pipeline processes and stores data**.
7. If pagination exists, **Scrapy follows the next page and repeats the process**.
8. **Execution stops when all pages are scraped**.
